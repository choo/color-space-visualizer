Color Space Visualizer
======================

3D Color Space Visualizer


Description
-----------

This application visualizes color space using 3DCG.

Color space is essentialy 3-dimensional vector space,
so it is difficult to understand it intuitively on 2D display
even though a nice color picking tool like color wheel.

This app shows RGB and HSV color space on 3D,
and helps intuitive understanding of color space through interaction.
Enjoy the play with the color space!
I hope you can become close to COLOR,
and realize that the colorful world we are living is so beautiful!

Note that this app is battery consuming on smart phones, because it uses GPU heavily to display 3D graphics smoothly.
